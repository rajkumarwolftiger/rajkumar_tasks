i will talk about the history of convolutional neural networks and i call this part of history as cats and it will become obvious why i call it so so around one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine hubel and wiesel did this famous experiment there is still i think you could see some videos of it on youtube where there is a cat and there is a screen in front of it and on screen there were these lines being displayed at different locations and at different locations and at different locations so slanted horizontal vertical and so on and there are some electrodes fitted to the cat and they were measuring trying to measure that which parts of brain actually respond to different visual stimuli so if you show it stimulus at a certain location there is a different part of the brain fire and so on so and one of the things of outcomes of the study was that different neurons in brain fire to only different types of stimuli it is not that all neurons in brain are always fired to any kind of visual stimuli that you give to them so this is essentially roughly the idea behind convolutional neural networks starting from something known as neocognitron which was proposed way back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty you could think of it as a very primitive convolutional neural network i am sure that most of you have now read about or heard about convolutional neural networks but something very similar to it was proposed way back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty and what we know as the modern convolutional neural networks may be i think jan likun is someone who proposed them way back in one thousand nine hundred and eightynine and he was interested in using them for the task of handwritten digit recognition and this was again in the context of postal delivery services so a lot of pin codes get written or phone numbers get written on the postcards and there is a requirement to read them automatically so that they can be the letters or postcards can be separated into different categories according to the postcard according to the postal code and so on so or the pin code so that is where this interest was there and one thousand nine hundred and eightynine was when this convolutional neural networks were first proposed or used for this task and then over the years several improvements were done to that and in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight this now famous dataset the mnist dataset which is used for teaching deep neural networks courses or even for initial experiments with various neural network based networks this is one of the popular datasets which is used in this field and this was again released way back in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight and even today even for my course i use it for various assignments and so on so it is interesting that an algorithm which was inspired by an experiment on cats is today used to detect cats in videos of course among other various other things is just i am just jokingly saying this
