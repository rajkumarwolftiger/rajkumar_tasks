computer science and engineering indian institute of technology madras lecture – partialbrief history of deep learning hello everyone welcome to lecture of cs  which is the course on deep learning in today’s lecture is going to be a bit non technical we are not going to cover any technical concepts or we only going to talk about a brief or partial history of deep learning so we hear the terms artificial neural networks artificial neurons quite often these days and i just wanted you take you through the journey of where does all these originate from and this history contains several spans across several fields not just computer science we will start with biology then talk about something in physics then eventually come to computer science and so on so with that let us start so just some acknowledgments and disclaimers i have taken lot of this material from the first people which i have mentioned on the bullet and there might still be some errors because its dates as back as so maybe i have got some of the facts wrong so let us start with the first chapter which is on biological neurons as i said its spans several fields will start with biology and we will first talk about the brain and neurons within the brainso way back in  around that time joseph von gerlach actually proposed that the nervous system our nervous system is a single continuous network as opposed to a network of many discrete cells so his idea was that this is one gigantic cell sitting in our nervous system and it is not a network of discrete cells and this theory was known as the reticular theory and around the same time there was the some breakthrough or some progress in staining techniques where camillo golgi discovered that a chemical reaction that would allow you to examine the neurons or the nervous tissue so he was again a proponent of reticular theory so this is about camillo golgi and then interestingly santiago cajal he used the same technique which golgi proposed and he studied the same tissue and he came up with the conclusion that this is not a single cell this is actually a collection of various discrete cells which together forms a network so it is a network of things as opposed to a single cell there so that is what his theory was and this was eventually came to be known as the neuron doctrine although this was not a consolidated in the form of a doctrine by cajal that was done by this gentleman so he coined the term neuron so now today when you think about art here about artificial neural networks or artificial neurons the term neuron actually originated way back in and this gentleman was responsible for coining that and he was also responsible for consolidating the neuron doctrine so already as you saw on the previous slide cajal had proposed it but then over the years many people bought this idea and this guy was responsible for consolidating that into a neuron doctrine interestingly he is not only responsible for coining the term neuron he is also responsible for coining the term chromosome so two very important terms were coined by this one person so now here is a question so around  when it was time to give the nobel prize in medicine what do you think which of these two proponents say there are two theories one is reticular theory which is a single cell and then there is this neuron doctrine which is a collection of cells or collection of neurons that a nervous system is a collection of neurons so what do you think which of these two guys who are proponents of these two different theories who would have got the actual nobel prize for medicine so interestingly it was given to both of them so till in fact way later till also this debate was not completely set settled and then the committee said both of these are interesting pieces of work we yet do not know what really actual what the situation is actually but these conflicting ideas have a place together and so the nobel prize was actually given to both of them and this led to a history of a some kind of controversies between these two scientists and so on and this debate surprisingly was settled way later in and not by progress in biology as such but by progress in a different field so this was with the advent of electron microscopy so now it was able to see this at a much better scale and by looking at this under a microscope it was found that actually there is a gap between these neurons and hence it is not a one single cell it is actually a collection or a network of cells with a clear gap between them or some connections between them which are now known as synapses so this was when the debate was settled so now why am i talking about biology why am i telling you about biological neuron and so on so this is what we need to understand so there has always been interested in understanding how the human brain works from a biological perspective at least and around this time the debate was more or less settled that we have this our brain is a collection of many neurons and they interact with each other to help us do a lot of complex processing that we do on a daily basis right from getting up in the morning and deciding what do we want to do today taking decisions performing computations and various complex things that our brain is capable of doing now the interest is in seeing if we understand how the brain works can we make an artificial model for that so can we come up with something which can simulate how our brain works and what is that model and how do we make a computer do that or how do we make a machine do that so that is why i started from biological neurons to take the inspiration from biology"}
